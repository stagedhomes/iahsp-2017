                        Plan to Stay in Either the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Clinton, Langley, Freeland, or the Greenbank areas</span>, as that is on South
                        Whidbey. South Whidbey is where Our ASPM<sup>速</sup> Educational Symposium and also the Masters Course will be
                        held. Do Not Stay in Oak Harbor, as it is too far away. To get to the island you will take the Mukilteo
                        Ferry from Mukilteo, WA on the mainland (north of Seattle taking the I-5 highway, watch for Mukilteo
                        ferry signs) to Clinton where the Ferry lands on Whidbey Island. It is only a 15 minute Ferry Ride once
                        you are on board. Plan ahead as there can be ferry lines to wait in to catch the boat which runs every
                        30 minutes from 5 AM to midnight.
