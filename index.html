                                        This session will help us to know how to price our services and get paid what we are worth.  Pricing is an art and science and many Stagers are fearful of losing an opportunity that they price lower than they should or don’t realize they could have charged more for Staging.  Just as we advise sellers not to leave money on the table by not Staging, we need to not leave money on the table as a professional Home Stager.  Pricing strategically helps create value in your business and ultimately yourself.
