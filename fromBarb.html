                            Our 2015 Educational Symposium Retreat for ASPM<sup>®</sup>'s is going to be unlike any other Symposium or
                            retreat you have ever attended.

                            This Symposium is a Symposium for ASPM’s<sup>®</sup>.  ASPM’s<sup>®</sup> will be able to share, network, interact,
                            and learn from other ASPM’s<sup>®</sup> about their businesses. We will participate in small group discussions,
                            learn from Masters Panels, Great Mastermind sessions and much more. Our Symposium will be interactive
                            in each session throughout the entire retreat. Every aspect we work with in our businesses as Masters
                            is on our agenda! By attending this private ASPM<sup>®</sup> educational Symposium retreat you will return home
                            with much more education on 'new marketing concepts, inventory ideas, pricing, team building, presentation
                            ideas, steps of how to grow your business to a higher level and more.'

                            This will be a very intense productive time for ASPM<sup>®</sup>’s filled to the brim with business exercises,
                            productive business practices, panels, and many ideas from each ASPM<sup>®</sup> in attendance. This will happen
                            in small groups and larger groups as well. These ideas you can put to use the minute you return to your
                            business and your community. We will have Fabulous Speakers, however there will be fewer ‘featured’ speakers in this event because I have chosen
                            to put the emphasis on our interactive agenda for you our ASPM<sup>®</sup>’s. Each of you is a star and your sharing
                            is and will be greatly appreciated at Symposium. I have always said, “more is more.” And the more who
                            share will always receive more back than given. Please see our agenda below and register now, today!
