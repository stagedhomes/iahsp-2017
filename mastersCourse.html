                                        “I really have a lot to share with the ASPs/ASPMs about what has happened in the past year ever since I
                                        took your ASPM Course on Whidbey Island.  Barb- it has been life changing for the positive... it has
                                        been so incredibly awesome- I have seen a lot of growth in my business, in both its structures and
                                        financially.  I have personally grown so much in the past year... it was like taking your Master’s course
                                        was this diamond encrusted gold key that really helped provide me the focus I needed.  I can share about
                                        how at year 6 I felt “stagnant” and seemed to get caught up in distraction.  Since our Master’s course
                                        and refocusing, I have restructured my entire business and have seen the beginning of growth and stability.
                                        I am delivering solid Stagings with very good results.”
